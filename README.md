# School-IDE
03/01/2024
---------
  As of right now, the "IDE" is only a simple text editor with quite a few issues.
  I plan on adding the following features:
  -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
  File Hierarchy (Repositional)
  Syntax Highlighting
  Auto-Completion
  Custom Compiler

  The current version lacks eveything required in an IDE. Although I'm not at the stage yet, I plan
  to be finished with the compiler by the end of the school year.
